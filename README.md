# metabolomics-tools
A compilation of code helpful in filtering, assessing data quality, and conducting first pass metabolomics analysis.

Divided into:

* [*First pass filtering*](https://github.com/CooperstoneLab/metabolomics-tools/blob/main/Metabolomics-filtering-template_github.md): takes data directly from MZmine, filters based on retention time, cleans up file names, removes unwanted samples, filtering based on presence in the QCs (both by number and by CV), removing features present in the process blanks.
